"""
Regulator / Compliance module.
Reviews every proposed trade for rule violations before execution.

Regulator agent enforces rules:
    MaxPositionLimit, BurstTrading, ManipulationPattern, etc.

This is an **autonomous compliance agent** – it receives proposed trades
from the Orchestrator, evaluates them against a rule set, and returns
APPROVE / WARN / BLOCK decisions.  It is NOT a chatbot.

    Regulator agent enforces rules: MaxPositionLimit, BurstTrading,
    ManipulationPattern, etc.

    **Goal**: Maintain market integrity by reviewing every proposed trade
    and blocking or adjusting those that violate compliance rules.

    **Rules enforced**:
        1. **MaxPositionLimit** – no agent may hold > 30 % of portfolio
           value in a single ticker.
        2. **MaxOrderSize** – single order cannot exceed 10 % of recent
           average volume.
        3. **ManipulationPattern / BurstTrading** – detects rapid-fire
           large orders (≥ 3 large orders in 5-step window) and blocks them.
        4. **AdversarialFlag** – large orders from adversarial agents are
           always flagged with a warning.
